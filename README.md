# Recursion-Algorithm-And-Structures-Practice

This repository contains a collection of exercises and implementations of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms, developed during my Computer Engineering studies. 

The implementations of the different Algorithms and data structures are from https://github.com/migueltoro/adda_v5

## 📂 Topics Covered

The codebase is organized by topic, focusing on three main areas:

### 1. Recursion
Solutions to problems using recursive or iterative logic to solve complex sub-problems with different implementations.
* **Key concepts:** Base cases, recursive calls, stack management.


### 2. Trees 🌲
Implementation of tree data structures and their associated algorithms.
* **Structures:** Binary Trees, General Trees.
* **Algorithms:**
    * Traversals (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order).
    * Calculation of properties (Height, Depth, Size).
    * Element search and manipulation.

### 3. Graphs 🕸️
Graph theory implementations and navigation algorithms.
* **Key concepts:** Different types of Graphs(Weighted, Directed...) and using algorithms associated with them.
* **Algorithms:**
    * Coloring algorithm
    * Pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra).
    * ...

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, Algorithmic Complexity.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each exercise is self-contained. To run a specific algorithm:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code).
3. Navigate to the specific topic folder (e.g., `src/trees`).
4. Run the `main` method of the desired file to see the output.
